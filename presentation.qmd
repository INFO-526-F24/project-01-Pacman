## Conclusion and Future Work

**Conclusion:** A 20% increase in discounts corresponds to a 35% rise in sales quantity, showing a strong positive relationship between these variables. Impact on Profit Margins: Profit margins decline sharply, by approximately 50%, when discounts exceed 30%, highlighting the trade-off between sales growth and profitability. Optimal Strategy: Discounts in the range of 10-20% appear to balance sales growth and profit margins effectively, maintaining profitability without excessive erosion.

**Future Work:** Customer Segmentation for Targeted Campaigns: Utilizing clustering techniques to identify distinct customer segments can help businesses design personalized marketing campaigns. For example, high-value customers may receive loyalty discounts, while price-sensitive customers can be targeted with volume-based offers.

Scenario Simulation for Strategic Planning: Running "what-if" simulations on different discount levels or pricing models can help businesses assess potential risks and rewards. This insight can guide strategic planning for promotions, especially during key events like Black Friday or holiday sales.

Incorporating External Trends: Integrating macroeconomic factors such as inflation or consumer sentiment can enhance discount strategies by aligning them with broader market conditions. For instance, adjusting discounts during economic downturns could help maintain customer loyalty and stabilize sales.
