## Abstract

The aim of the project is to analyze and extract meaningful insights from E-commerce sales data using the Supstore Dataset (2019-2022). The study aims to find important trends and patterns that drive customer engagement and profitability by looking at demographic influences and product category achievement. Data analysis approaches such as exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling are used to discover links between consumer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and sales results. The insights obtained are designed to influence strategic decision-making, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize product offerings, eventually encouraging business development and competitive edge.
