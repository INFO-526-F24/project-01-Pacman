## Abstract

This project dives into e-commerce transaction data to uncover patterns in how people shop, what they buy, and which factors drive sales across different regions and times of the year. By analyzing details like product categories, customer demographics, payment methods, and seasonal trends, this study aims to highlight key insights, such as when and where sales peak, which customer groups make high-value purchases, and how discounts impact profitability. The findings offer a deeper understanding of consumer choices and sales dynamics, helping to shape strategies for boosting engagement and optimizing performance in the e-commerce space.
