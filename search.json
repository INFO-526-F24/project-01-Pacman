    "text": "Data Description\n\nSource of the Data\nThis dataset comes from Kaggle and includes transaction records from different shopping malls and regions, designed to give a broad overview of consumer habits, sales patterns, and seasonal trends in e-commerce.\n\n\nCollection Information\nThe data covers all authorizations from October 1, 2006, to March 31, 2024. During this period, any transaction extensions, such as those for Working Capital, were approved under original agreements made before a temporary halt in EXIM Bank’s authority. No new transactions were approved during that lapse; only extensions of previous agreements were processed. This dataset was transferred to Catalog.Data.gov in September 2023 after Data.EXIM.gov ceased operations. With its multi-year scope, the dataset offers a consistent view of transaction details, customer demographics, and location-specific data, making it well-suited for financial and trend analyses over time.\n\n\nDescription of Observations\nThis dataset includes various types of information, organized into the following categories:\nTransaction Details: Each transaction record includes a timestamp, the total amount, and any discounts applied, which are useful for analyzing financial patterns and identifying seasonal shifts in sales.\nProduct Information: Each item sold is categorized, enabling an analysis of product trends within specific categories and helping to segment the data by product type.\nCustomer Demographics: Information on customers’ age and gender supports demographic analysis, helping to reveal spending preferences and behaviors across different customer groups.\nRegional Indicators: Transactions are associated with specific shopping malls or regions, making it possible to compare how different locations perform.\nPayment Methods: The dataset captures the type of payment used—such as credit card, mobile payment, or cash—which provides insights into payment preferences and how they may affect profit margins."

    "text": "Ethical Considerations\nWhile the dataset includes customer demographic details like age and gender, it does not contain any personal identifiers, helping to maintain privacy. Since the dataset is publicly available on Kaggle, it appears any necessary anonymization was applied beforehand. However, careful interpretation is needed when using demographic data to avoid inadvertently reinforcing stereotypes or drawing unsupported conclusions about certain groups."

This question will help identify peak seasons and preferred payment options during high-demand periods.\nWhich Customer Demographics (Gender, Age) Contribute the Most to High-Value Transactions, and in which Regions or Categories?\nThrough this question we aim to identify customer segments that account for the highest-value transactions, focusing on demographics, regions, and categories preferred by these customers.\nWhat Are the Relationships Between Discounted Prices, Sales Volumes, and Profit Margins in Different Shopping Malls and Product Categories?\nThrough this question, we will examine the influence of discounts on sales volumes and profit margins, analyzing correlations across product categories and shopping malls.\nWhat Is the Impact of Payment Methods on Profit Margins Across Different Categories and Regions Over Time?\nWe will analyze how different payment methods affect profit margins, observing variations by product category and region over time."
